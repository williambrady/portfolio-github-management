# AVD-AWS-0057: IAM policy wildcard finding
# Applies to: cloudformation/github-oidc-terraform-state.yaml (GitHubActionsRole)
# Justification: The wildcard (*) in the OIDC subject claim
# (repo:org/repo:*) is the AWS-recommended pattern for GitHub OIDC
# integration, allowing any branch/ref/action to assume the role.
